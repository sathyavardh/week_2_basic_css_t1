        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I graduated from Kongu Engineering College with a bachelor's degree in electronics and communication engineering. 
            I worked on a number of projects in the fields of web development, machine learning, embedded systems, 
            image processing, and the Internet of Things when I was in college. My current area of interest is full-stack 
            programming, and I'm always picking up new front-end and back-end development frameworks. As a data fanatic, 
            I'm constantly excited to investigate and evaluate data in order to spur creativity and new ideas. I've been able to 
            advance my career at GWC Data.ai Company, where I currently work. My objective is to land a solid job in a reputable 
            company merging full-stack development and IoT, where I may advance my professional development.</p>
